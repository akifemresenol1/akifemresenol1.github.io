              Hi. I'm Akif Emre Åženol, nice to meet you. Please take a look
              around.

              I'm still at the junior level in frontend development, but I am
              determined to work in this field and improve my skills. In
              addition to being familiar with React.JS, I also have experience
              in basic web technologies such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I hope
              you get to know me better and if you want to reach me or talk
              about your projects, please feel free to contact me. Thanks!
            </p>
